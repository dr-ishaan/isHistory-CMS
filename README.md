# isHistory CMS

> **Your Astro website's control panel — inside Obsidian.**

Write your blog posts and research notes in Obsidian. This plugin checks they're perfect, then helps you publish them to your Astro website.

---

## What Does This Plugin Do?

Think of it like a **spell-checker for your blog posts**, but instead of checking spelling, it checks that every post has all the information your Astro website needs to display it properly.

Here's what you get:

| Feature | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | See all your blog posts in one place, like a spreadsheet |
| **Validation** | The plugin tells you if a post is missing something (like a title or date) |
| **Pre-flight** | Marks a draft as ready for deployment (frontmatter only; deploy via Git sync) |
| **Quick validate sidebar** | See errors on the post you're currently editing |
| **Bulk pre-flight** | Mark many draft posts as ready for deployment at once |
| **Track system** | Organize posts by type — articles, profiles, or events |
| **Status bar** | See your content health at a glance in Obsidian's status bar |
| **Sort & filter** | Find posts fast with sort options, search, and filters |
| **Context menus** | Right-click files for quick validate and pre-flight actions |
| **Safe upgrades** | Settings automatically merge when you update — nothing is lost |

## How to Set Up Your Vault

Your Obsidian vault needs to look like your Astro project's content folder for the plugin to find your posts.

The plugin looks for content inside `src/content` by default. Your vault should have this structure:

```
your-vault/
  src/
    content/
      blog/           ← Your blog posts (archive collection)
        A1-the-ancient-dream-of-artificial-life.md
        P1-ada-lovelace.md
        E1-the-dartmouth-conference-1956.md
        ...
      vault/          ← Your research notes (vault collection)
        vision-and-architecture.md
        content-schema.md
        ...
```

**The easiest way:** Open your entire Astro project folder as your Obsidian vault. That way, the `src/content` path matches automatically.

### If Your Content Is Somewhere Else

1. Go to **Settings → isHistory CMS**
2. Change the **Archive path** or **Vault path** to wherever your content lives
3. For example, if you just have blog posts in a `posts/` folder, type `posts`

## How to Write a Blog Post

Every blog post needs a special block at the very top called **frontmatter**. It tells your Astro website everything it needs to know about the post.

### Blog Post Template (Archive Collection)

Copy this template and fill in your own information:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title Here"
date: 2026-05-28
description: "A short one-line description of your post (15 to 160 characters)."
draft: false
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
image: "/images/your-hero-image.jpg"
series: "minds-and-machines"
seriesOrder: "A1"
track: "A"
status: "published"
part: "Part I · The Dream"
figures: "Person One, Person Two, Person Three"
connects: "P2, A5, E1"
era: "Ancient – 1850"
---

Your amazing blog post content goes here...
```

### Vault Note Template

```markdown
---
title: "Your Note Title"
created: 2026-05-28
updated: 2026-05-28
author: Ishaan
description: "What this note is about."
publish: true
tags: [meta, research, notes]
order: 1
relatedChapters: "A5, P2, E1"
---

Your research note content goes here...
```

## What Each Field Means

## Common Mistakes the Plugin Catches

The plugin checks your posts and shows you exactly what's wrong. Here are the most common problems:

| Problem | What's Wrong | How to Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Missing title | No `title` field in frontmatter | Add `title: "Your Title"` |
| Missing date | No `date` field | Add `date: 2026-05-28` |
| Bad date format | Date is not in YYYY-MM-DD format | Use `2026-05-28` not `May 28, 2026` |
| Tags not a list | `tags` is a string instead of a list | Use `["tag1", "tag2"]` not `"tag1, tag2"` |
| Has series but no order | `series` is set but `seriesOrder` is missing | Add `seriesOrder: "A1"` |
| Missing description | No `description` field | Add `description: "Your description here"` |
| Draft + published conflict | `draft: true` but `status: "published"` | Set `draft: false` or `status: "upcoming"` |
| Invalid track code | `track` is not one of your defined tracks | Use a track code from Settings |
| seriesOrder track mismatch | `seriesOrder` starts with a different track letter than `track` | Make them match |

2. Search for **"Open quick validate"**
3. The sidebar shows real-time validation as you type

---

## Commands

You can access these from the command palette (`Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P`):

| Command | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `Open isHistory dashboard` | Opens the full content management dashboard |
| `Open quick validate` | Opens the sidebar validator |

| `Validate all content` | Validates all content and shows summary |
| `Bulk pre-flight all drafts` | Marks all draft posts as ready for deployment |

---

## Deploying to Your Site

Pre-flighting a post marks it as ready for deployment, but doesn't push it live. To deploy changes to your Astro site:

1. Install [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git)
2. Configure it to auto-commit and push on interval (e.g., every 5 minutes)
3. Your Astro site's CI/CD (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, etc.) detects the push and rebuilds automatically

That's the full pipeline: **Write → Pre-flight → Git sync → Auto-deploy**

You can also use any other Git sync method you prefer — the plugin only manages frontmatter, so any tool that commits and pushes your vault to your Astro repo will work.

## FAQ

### The dashboard shows "No content found"

Make sure your **Archive path** or **Vault path** in settings matches where your content actually is. If your posts are in `src/content/blog/`, the archive path should be `src/content/blog`.

### BRAT says "frozen" next to my plugin version

That's normal! In BRAT, "(frozen)" just means the plugin is pinned to a specific version. It does NOT mean the plugin is broken. Your plugin is working fine.

### How do I update the plugin?

**Community Store:** Settings → Community Plugins → Click "Check for updates" → Update
**Manual:** Download the latest release files and replace the old ones.
**BRAT:** BRAT settings → Check for updates → Update.

### The plugin is slow with many posts

Go to **Settings → isHistory CMS** and lower the **Cards per page** number. Try 20 instead of 40.

### I clicked Pre-flight but my site didn't update

Pre-flight only changes frontmatter in your vault. You still need to sync your vault to Git (using Obsidian Git or another tool) for your Astro site to rebuild and deploy. See the **Deploying to Your Site** section above.

### Will updating the plugin delete my settings?

No! The plugin uses a deep-merge strategy that reads your existing settings, keeps everything you configured, and only adds any new fields that didn't exist before. Your settings are always safe.

### Do I need to know regex to use custom tracks?

No! The default settings work great out of the box. Regex is only used internally to match seriesOrder patterns based on your track codes. You just pick a short code (like "A", "P", "E") and the plugin handles the rest.

## Built For

This plugin is designed for the **isHistory** Astro project — a deep-dive into the history of Artificial Intelligence. It uses:

- **Astro** with Content Collections
- **Two content collections**: `archive` (blog posts) and `vault` (research notes)
- **Series system**: Articles (A), Profiles (P), Events (E) — each organized into tracks

But it works with any Astro project that uses content collections!

---

## Security

- Release assets are built via GitHub Actions with **artifact attestations** for cryptographic provenance verification
- No `innerHTML` usage — all DOM manipulation uses Obsidian's `createEl` API
- No `!important` in CSS — proper selector specificity is used instead
- No `builtin-modules` npm dependency — uses Node.js built-in `module.builtinModules`
